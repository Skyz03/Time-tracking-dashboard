## Overview
This is an intresting challange where I learned a lot about CSS Flexbox and Grids to make the layout as perfect as possible.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

## My process
Bulit the left side of the box and then followed by the right side of the box using the CSS Grid.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned about the CSS Grid and the use of top elements to give them seprate color, plus the use of implementation of SCSS as per order of functions use.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

Use of JSON file to change the data plus the use of keyboard and mouse for access the time activity.
